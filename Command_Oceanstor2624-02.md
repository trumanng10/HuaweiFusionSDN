Hereâ€™s a guide for setting up **zones, LUNs, and related configurations** on a Huawei SAN (Storage Area Network) switch and storage system. This involves zoning on the SAN switch and LUN configuration on the storage array.

## **1. Zoning on a Huawei SAN Switch**

Zoning is used to control which hosts can see which storage devices on the SAN fabric.

### **Commands to Set Up Zoning**
1. **Log in to the SAN Switch:**
   ```
   ssh admin@<SAN_SWITCH_IP>
   ```

2. **Display Existing Zones:**
   ```
   zoneshow
   ```

3. **Create a Zone:**
   ```
   zonecreate "zone_name", "port_id1;port_id2"
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   zonecreate "zone1", "1,1;1,2"
   ```

4. **Add a Zone to a Zone Configuration:**
   ```
   cfgadd "cfg_name", "zone_name"
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   cfgadd "cfg1", "zone1"
   ```

5. **Save the Configuration:**
   ```
   cfgsave
   ```

6. **Enable the Zone Configuration:**
   ```
   cfgenable "cfg_name"
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   cfgenable "cfg1"
   ```

7. **Verify the Configuration:**
   ```

## **2. LUN Configuration on Huawei OceanStor**

LUNs (Logical Unit Numbers) are storage volumes presented to the host.

### **Steps to Set Up LUNs**
1. **Log in to the OceanStor Management GUI.**

2. **Create a Storage Pool:**
   - Navigate to **Storage Pools**.
   - Click **Create**.
   - Configure the RAID level and disk types.

3. **Create a LUN:**
   - Navigate to **LUN Management** > **Create LUN**.
   - Enter the LUN name, size, and select the storage pool.
   - Confirm and save the settings.

4. **Map the LUN to a Host:**
   - Go to **Host Management**.
   - Create a new host and enter the host's WWN or iSCSI initiator.
   - Map the LUN to the host.

5. **Verify LUN Mapping:**
   - Check that the host can detect the LUN in the **Host Management** section.

## **3. Verify Host Access**

After zoning and LUN mapping:
1. **On the Host:**
   - Rescan for disks (Windows/Linux).
   - Ensure the new LUN is visible.

2. **For Linux Hosts:**
   ```
   echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/hostX/scan
   ```
   Replace `hostX` with the appropriate host adapter.

3. **For Windows Hosts:**
   - Use Disk Management to verify the new disk.
   - Format and assign a drive letter if required.

---

## **4. Best Practices**
- Always create zones with a single initiator and multiple targets for better isolation.
- Use descriptive names for zones and LUNs for easier management.
- Test access from the host to the LUN before deploying in production.
- Backup configurations regularly.
